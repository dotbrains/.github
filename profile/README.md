# Dotbrains

A collective dedicated to the craft of software engineering whose mission is to make the world better through software.

## About Us

In ancient times, alchemy was a mix of philosophy and pseudoscience, lacking the rigorous measurement and testing we rely on today. One legendary pursuit was the Philosopher's Stone, believed to transmute ordinary metals into precious ones like silver and gold, and act as an elixir of life, curing illness, restoring youth, and granting immortality. While these aspirations were never realized, we now have a modern equivalent: software engineering. Through software, human thought and creativity are continuously transformed into solutions for real-world problems, yielding innovative products and services.

At Dotbrains, this is our essence. We dedicate ourselves to mastering the craft of software engineering, turning expertise into joy and a fulfilling life. Creating high-quality software that meets user needs demands time, meticulous attention to detail, and strict discipline. Software must be ethical, protecting user data and privacy, improving lives by automating the mundane and dangerous, and bringing joy to users. This journey begins here.
