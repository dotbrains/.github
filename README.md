    A personal card for dotbrains (@dotbrains) üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welcome to Dotbrains! We are a collective dedicated to the craft of software engineering, driven by a mission to make the world better through software. Our journey is fueled by a passion for innovation, creativity, and the transformative power of technology. We believe that software is more than just code; it's a tool that can enhance lives, solve complex problems, and create new opportunities.

## About

This project provides a simple CLI tool to get to know Dotbrains. When you run `npx dotbrains`, you'll be greeted with a friendly message introducing you to our mission and values.

## Usage

To use this tool, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

Once you have Node.js installed, you can use `npx` to run the Dotbrains CLI tool:

```sh
npx dotbrains
```

Running the command above will display a welcome message and provide you with information about Dotbrains.

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command; that'd be creepy. ü§®
